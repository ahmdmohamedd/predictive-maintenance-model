# predictive-maintenance-model
A predictive maintenance model using Random Forest Regressor and LSTM for industrial equipment. The system predicts the remaining useful life (RUL) based on sensor and operational data, with performance evaluation through MAE and R^2 score for both models. Suitable for equipment failure prediction.
